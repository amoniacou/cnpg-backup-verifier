                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.
